px -> y

y - eps -> p x - eps
y - eps -> (p - eps/x) x

y - eps -> p0x0 + p1x1 - eps
we can now split eps with p0 and p1 somehow - like change only one param - the one that was changed last time - or if 0 on this param than choose randomly

p x - eps = (p + dp) x

-eps = dp x
dp = -eps/x



y = 1/(1+exp(-(x-dx)))

-1
